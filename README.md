# pred-brain
Building microcircuits that simulate how the predictive brain works. Incorporating hierarchy, confidence and prediction error across multiple brain regions using just pure python. This was done without relying on pre-existing bayesian brain packages like PyHGF, etc.

Part II, where I incorporate object oriented programming, different brain regions, and hierarchical (2-layer) models can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13yCJlSI1rvHQ2J1xE5f7RTf9ReXKLW07?usp=sharing). Once it's neatened up, I'll upload the .ipynb here as well.
